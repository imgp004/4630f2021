In our first week, we focused on developing the login and register page for our app. Using EditText, a user can input email and password. An editText is used to get user input and save them in variables. There are clickable textviews through which user can switch between login and register screen. A textView is used to display a text on screen. Two button, login and register are positioned on the screen. Clicking register button, userâ€™s email and password will be saved in firebase authentication. Then user can click on login button and the email and password, and the Login activity verifies the credentials with the one that are saved in firebase. An onCompleteListener function is used to give tasks to perform after a task is completed. Here, we are verifying a user if it is existing in firebase. If the  task is successful, the screen intents to home screen else it gives a toast, displaying the error. We have onStart and onCreate functions implemented to verify the existing user. With that, user will stay logged in every time the app is opened. This is how we login a user to this app.
