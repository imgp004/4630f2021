In the second week, we focused on working with home screen layout and back-end programming. It starts with a tool bar on the top of the screen. A separate tool bar layout is created and then bonded it with this home screen using Toolbar library. It consists of a title, and a drawer button. This button will pull out the drawer when clicked once. It consists of options of profile, post, logout, and more. A separate layout named menu is created that has all these options. Drawer also holds a user profile image and username. A separate layout named header is created that holds these two things and it is bonded with the drawer layout using inflateHeader function. In this activity, there are two variables, firebaseAuth and userRef. FirebaseAuth holds the instance of current user and by using it, we can identify that user existence in firebase database. On start of this home activity, onStart function will verify it the profile image, full name, town name of current user is existing in firebase database. If nothing is found, it will redirect user to profile activity to get user information. If the information is found, then user will be able to stay on home screen and has access to all options in drawer layout. At last, user can also logout. When logout option is selected, using firebaseAuth, we call signOut function and intent user to login page.
