In the third week, we started designing the profie activity. The profile activity is using CropImage library. The circularImage is set on cliackable. So, When the CircularImage view is clicked, the screen is intended to gallery of userâ€™s phone from where user can select a profile image. This file type is selected as image. So, user will only be able to select images from file directory. Here, CropImage library allows users to crop an image and set it as profile picture. Using the firebase storage reference, this profile image is saved in a folder with a unique name (all user ids are unique) and the path to this image is saved in current user node of firebase database. And further, the full name, town name is also saved in database after the Save button is pressed. Then the screen intents back to the home screen. The profile image in the drawer layout is displayed using Picasso library. The drawer in home screen allows user to visit again in the profile activity to modify the existing information.
