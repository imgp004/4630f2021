As we progressed in fourth week, we started working on post activity. Our plan was to let user post picture with description and save it in database. So, a post activity is created, and it contains a image view, text input for description and buttons. On clicking search button, a intent to gallery is generated and from where user can select any image to post. On clicking upload button, this image is stored in firebase storage using storage reference in a folder that only contains post images. Here, we have tried to give each image a unique name. So, the code combines current user id with current date and time including seconds to create a unique name of the post image. The path to this image is stored in firebase database in post node, which also holds description, date time, and user information who posted it. User will be notified through a toast that that image is posted and saved.
