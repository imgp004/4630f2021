Abstract 

Studies shows that U.S. consumers waste about 150,000 tons of food daily. We cannot control the corporate 
polluters and their contribution to climate change but cutting food waste, we can fight climate change 
and we should all be doing it. 
Our mobile app programming project is focused to solve food waste problems. Majority of food waste is 
done from restaurants, farms, and retail like Walmart. We have an idea to design an app by which a restaurant
owner or manager can take pictures and description of fresh food that is leftover and upload on this platform. 
The user from nearby area will get notify if they are interested in consuming it. Here, the person can
decide if they want to donate it or sell it in low price.
We are going to use Android Studio to program this app. Dose such app already exists. Yes. But it has some issues
that we are focused to solve here. I had to login twice to open this app and it does not have option to donate 
leftover fresh food. We are creating an app that will have option of either sell or donate the leftover fresh food.
