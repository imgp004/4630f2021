Concept: Leftover Food Donation app
Does an app already exists: Yes.
Name of existing app: Too Good To Go.
Like or Dislike: Neutral
Reason: I opened this app and I didnt found any restaurants in the max range in this app. This app is designed very well but very less people know about it. 
Restaurants plays very important role here. There should be two different interface. Like Uber. There are different apps for uber driver and for uber customer.

Comments [I want to design an app that can be handeled by restaurants as well as people. With the help of both interection, 
it will be easier for restaurants to tell people in nearby areas about leftover food availablity.]
